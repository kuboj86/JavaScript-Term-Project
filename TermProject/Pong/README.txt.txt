This is just your classic Pong game. Move your mouse up and down to control your
paddle.

Current Issues:
Since the AI is programmed to just follow the ball and the speed of the AI paddle is based on
the speed of the ball, it's basically impossible to beat it :(

Once the ball starts moving , it always move in the same trajectory no matter where on the paddle the ball 'hits'

plans to resolve the problems or issues:

To resolve this issue I would need to play around with the function to reduce the speed of the AI's paddle
to be a little slower than that of the ball. I ultimately ran out of time trying to resole this .

plans for future releases:

Future plans would be to allow the trajectory of the ball to change depending on where it 'hits' the paddle
Allow a way to keep scores to view later.
Level difficulties which would increase how "smart" the AI is.
Potentially more than 1 ball.

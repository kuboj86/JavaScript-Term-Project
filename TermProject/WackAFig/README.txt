Offbrand version of Wack-a-Mole where the objective is to click on the fig when it appears on the screen before it hides back behind the bush.

CURRENT ISSUES:

You have a bit of leeway with where you need to click. Instead of only having to click the actualy fig image,
 if you successfuly click anywhere within the "hole" element, it will register as a successful hit and award the point.

No way of knowing when the game ends/ is over

PLANS TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS OR ISSUES:

Not 100% sure how to resolve the "hit box". Would probably need to adjust the actual "hole" elements to a height/width that better reflects the size
of the fig image.

Creating a timer that counts down from 20(the current game time) would be a great start which would just require creating a label on the page and passing in
the setTimeout value.

PLANS FOR FUTURE RELEASE:
Score Tracker
Timer display
Difficulty levels that increase or descrease the time in which a fig is visible for.
A better overall layout of the hole locations
